# This is a type of function in Rego. In this case the exact value is in the parameter position of the function. So if the value passed to this
# function is `0`, the funtion will return "Only People In Your Organization". This is useful if you are guarranteed to be passed certain values.
# This works because duplicate names are treated similar to an if else train.

# You must always have a default funtion, otherwise if the value passed is not one of the explicitaly stated value above, it will return undefined.
# Undefined is not great because it allows for false positive or negatives. There are times when an undefined is intended, but you should code so it
# dosn't appear when unintended. Functions and Rule Sets can return multiple results, in this case we are returning a scalar value (string).
# So if multiple values are returned, Rego will stop with an error. To prevent that we check if the value passed is one of the expected values [0,1,2,3]
# by using a array item check. Only then will the string "Unknown" be returned.
SliderSettings(Value) := "Unknown" if not Value in [0, 1, 2, 3]

# This is unique to SharePoint. The PowerShell script that pull from the tenant force the results into an array. Becuase we know that there should be only
# one item in the array on a normal run, we save that item in a variable called Tenant. This prevents the need to loop through the SPO_tenant array for
# each policy. This is a techique used to reduce extranious/duplicate code.

# This value is used so much, someone decided to just store it in a variable. This is more of a nuetral code line/ personal choice.

# This string is used in multiple policies as part of the report details. Becuase the string is dependent on the sharing capability set in
# the json concat is utilized instead of hard coding. The function concat takes a deliminater for between the strings and an array of stings to
# be concatanated. Because variables in Rego are imutable, you must save the function output to a new variable. In this case the deliminater is an
# empty string because we wanted to add a period. An example of the string save in `SharingString` is "External Sharing is set to Anyone."

# This is a report details string you will see often. We have some policies that are Not Applicable because the settings cannot be pulled from the
# tenant currently or the check is too complex to do cleanly & reliably. Similar to the function above concat is used to create a string that reflects
# the current sharing setting set in the tenant with an addition. The %v is a formatter, so when this string is fed to another function the %v will be
# replaced with a html link for the report generated.

# Sharepoint Rego Example
#
# Policy logic: If SharingCapability is set to Only People In Organization OR Existing Guests, the policy should pass.
#
# Code logic: Each policy in SCuBA is tested in a tests rule set. Rule sets are CASE SENSITIVE. It must be tests, not: Tests, test, etc.
# the contains keyword allows multiple values to be returned (not to be confused with the contains() function). Each tests rule set (policy)
# returns: policy id, criticality, commandlet, actual value, report details, and requirement met. The policy id, criticality can be found in
# the baseline. The commandlet is the Powershell command used to pull the tenant settings needed to test compliance with this policy.
# The last 3: actual value, report details, and requirement met are determined by the rego code. Actual vaule is the setting information the
# user would need to fix the tenant if the policy check fails. The report details is a descriptive string to better explain the policy pass/fail.
# The requrement met is a boolean, true == pass, false == fail. Continuing logic explination in rule set.
tests contains {
    "PolicyId": "MS.SHAREPOINT.1.1v1",

    "RequirementMet": Status
} if {
    # The policy is an OR comparison. If SharingCapability is set to ONLYPEOPLEINORG OR EXISTINGGUESTS. In rego there are a few ways to do this.
    # Because the check is so simple we chose to use a comprehension. Comprehensions are shorthand rule sets. For example:
    #
    # Rule Set
    # default ExampleRuleSet := false
    # ExampleRuleSet := true if {
    #   SharingCapability == ONLYPEOPLEINORG
    #}
    # ExampleRuleSet := true if {
    #   SharingCapability == EXISTINGGUESTS
    #}
    #
    # Comprehension
    # Result := [Condition | some Condition in [SharingCapability == ONLYPEOPLEINORG, SharingCapability == EXISTINGGUESTS]; Condition == true]
    #
    # The rule set returns true if either case is true, otherwise false. The comprehension is split into three parts. Result is the variable the
    # the result of the comprehension is saved in like ExampleRuleSet is for the rule set. Condition on the left side of the pipe is the value that
    # will be saved in result if the condition passes. The right side of the array to the ; is the loop. It is a some in loop use to declare a mutable
    # temporary variable for the loop. In this case we are looping through an array of booleans created by comparing the SharingCapability value to
    # constants. Everything after the FIRST ; is a condition, you can have multiple conditions in a comprehension. In the comprehension, it is incased
    # by [] making the return value an array, you can also return a set by using {}. All together this returns an array of true values for each true value
    # in the array we are looping through.
    #
    # Because this tpe of comprehension is used often, we have a key function named FilterArray.
    Conditions := [
        SharingCapability == ONLYPEOPLEINORG,
        SharingCapability == EXISTINGGUESTS
    ]
    # We pass it an array of booleans ( our OR comparisons) and we are checking if any are true, so the boolean value passed is true. FilterArray returns
    # an array, so we use count() (NOT Count) to get the size. In this instance we can only get 2 sizes, 0 or 1. For the policy to pass we need a size
    # of 1. We store the result of that comparison in status so we can pass the result to report details & requirement met.
    Status := count(FilterArray(Conditions, true)) == 1

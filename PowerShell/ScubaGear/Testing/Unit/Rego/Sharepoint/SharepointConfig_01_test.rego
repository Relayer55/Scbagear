# Sharepoint Rego Unit Test Example
#
# Code logic: test_ MUST start each unit test name (rule set). _Correct ends the unit test name if the case results in a requirements met. _Incorrect
# ends the unit test if the case results in a requirements not met. The key values that are altered during the unit test should be the middle of the
# unit test name. Lastly there should not be any duplicate test names, so _V# should be appended to the end to prevent duplicates. This type of unit
# tests are called (by SCuBA) Basic Top Down approach. These tests are characterized by the policies being fed a hard coded json. This method is prone to
# copy & paste errors. Continuing logic explination in rule set.
test_SharingCapability_Correct_V1 if {
    # A hard coded json is bound as the input for all tests rule set in the sharepoint package (SharepointConfig.rego) and run results are stored in
    # the Output variable. To be clear ALL tests rule sets are run, so we have to filter later for the specific policy we want.

        ]
    }

    # This is a key function to simplify unit testing. Just pass the specific policy id you are testing, the Output var, what string the report
    # details should contain, and if requrement met is true or false. The result of TestResult() should ALWAYS equal true.
